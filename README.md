# YouTube Video & Audio Downloader

This Python script allows you to download YouTube videos in different resolutions or as audio-only files. If the selected quality is only available as separate video and audio streams, the script automatically downloads both and merges them into a single file.

It provides:

* Automatic validation of YouTube links
* A choice of resolutions (excluding very low quality such as 144p)
* An audio-only option (`.m4a`)
* Automatic merging of adaptive streams using `moviepy`
* Simple command-line interaction

---

## Features

* âœ… Download progressive YouTube streams directly (video + audio)
* âœ… Download adaptive streams (video-only) and merge with audio
* âœ… Audio-only download option (`128kbps`)
* âœ… Automatic cleaning of video titles into safe file names
* âœ… Error handling for unavailable videos or invalid URLs
